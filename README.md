### Abstract
This project aims to provide a solution that aids decision makers in effective fund allocation when infrastructure upgrades are targeted, specifically when said infrastructure is to be improved for persons with disabilities.

It is done by developing a mobile, battery powered route logging device, based on the Arduino Uno microcontroller, which transmits route data to a web application via a GSM modem. The data is then processed so that it may be visually categorised based on the traffic each section of the route generates. Lastly, the visually categorised data is displayed on a map.

A fully functional prototype system is developed with success that suggests it could be a viable solution in the commercial arena.
